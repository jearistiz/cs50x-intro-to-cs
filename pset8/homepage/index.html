        <h1>What is Quantum Computing?</h1>
        <p>
          Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to
          perform computation. Computers that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computer. Quantum
          computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization
          (which underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical computers. The study of quantum
          computing is a subfield of quantum information science.

          The basic unit of quantum computing is a quantum superposition of the states 0 and 1.
          This quantum superposition is called a <b>qubit</b> and mathematically can be expressed as (click on the
          equation to enlarge):

          Each qubit can be mathematically represented as a point in a sphere, usually called the <b>Bloch Sphere</b>, as shown in the
          image below (click on the image to read more about the Bloch Sphere)

        <h2>What is so special about Quantum Computation?</h2>
        <p>
          Any computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also, in principle, be solved by
          a quantum computer. Conversely, quantum computers obey the Church–Turing thesis; that is, any computational
          problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer. While this means
          that quantum computers provide no additional advantages over classical computers in terms of computability,
          they do in theory enable the design of algorithms for certain problems that have significantly lower time
          complexities than known classical algorithms. Notably, quantum computers are believed to be able to quickly
          solve certain problems that no classical computer could solve in any feasible amount of time—a feat known as
          "quantum supremacy." The study of the computational complexity of problems with respect to quantum computers
          is known as quantum complexity theory.
