# PHYS Simulation

**Github repository:** <https://github.com/jearistiz/phys_simulation>

**Documentation:** <https://phys-simulation.readthedocs.io>

PHYS Simulation is a web application and API built on top of
[FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi).
Using PHYS Simulation you can request simulations of some physical or
mathematical systems such as the Harmonic Oscillator or the Chen-Lee Attractor
â€“and soon many others, stay tuned!

## Install PHYS Simulation

1. Before installing PHYS Simulation make sure you
  [install pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/).

2. To download PHYS Simulation clone it from the github repository using the
  following command

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/jearistiz/phys_simulation
    ```

3. Change to the directory where PHYS Simulation is installed

    ```bash
    $ cd phys_simulation
    ```

4. Create a virtual environment and install all the requirements using
  ``pipenv``(this can take several minutes)

    ```bash
    $ pipenv install
    ```

5. Activate the virtual environment

    ```bash
    $ pipenv shell
    ```

6. Finally run the web application in your localhost <http://0.0.0.0:5700/>

    ```bash
    $ pipenv run simulation_api
    ```

    You can manage ``HOST`` and ``PORT`` variables in the server configuration
    file ``~/phys_simulation/config.py``.

**NOTE:** If you want to remove the virtual environment after using the app
move to ``~/phys_simulation/``directory and run

```bash
$ pipenv --rm
```
